Android Auto Apps Downloader (AAAD) is an app for Android Phones that downloads popular Android Auto 3rd party apps and installs them in the correct way to have them in Android Auto. 

For the first time in 3 years, now users with **non-rooted Android devices** can enjoy these apps made for Android Auto, and Android Auto Apps Downloader does it all for you. Simply select an app you want to install on your phone and the download will begin. Once completed, install the given app with the classic Android interface and you can start enjoying the app you’ve just downloaded on Android Auto.

### No need for a PC. No developer options. No need of grabbing APKs and patch them. No root needed

AAAD can be easily installed on any Android phone and the whole installing process takes place only on it. You will not need to activate developer settings, neither in main settings nor in Android Auto. 

The main goal of this app is having the listed apps in Android Auto with a pain free experience and, most of all, without requiring a rooted phone. 

If you are instead running a rooted device, you might want to consider the free alternative [AA AIO TWEAKER](https://github.com/shmykelsa/AA-Tweaker), which has an alternative root method to patch the apps and it has a lot of other cool features that you can activate or pre-activate on Android Auto!

AAAD is free and offers in app purchases. The free version of the app allows up to 1 download every 30 days. With the PRO version you can enjoy the full experience and download as many times as you want, forever!

# Notes

Android Auto Apps Downloader **does not grant** in any way that the provided apps available for installing will actually work on Android Auto. The installing method can fail anytime if Google applies changes to Android Auto. Any software installed by Android Auto Apps Downloader is provided "as it is" and no support can be given by me for malfunctioning apps or malfunctioning Android Auto. 

# F.A.Q.

### How do I obtain a license?

To get started, press the bottom text on AAAD.

### Can I pay for a license outside the app?

Sure you can. Feel free to [pay through Stripe](https://buy.stripe.com/14k5mQ3ih6l7dMs8ww) or donate any amount (equal or bigger than the asking price - 3.50 EUR) [via PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=V666UVPT9C5CJ), and keep the donation receipt (bank statement, confirmation page, e-mail etc.). Then please [click here](mailto:help.aaad@gmail.com?subject=%5BGW%5D&body=Please%20don%E2%80%99t%20modify%20the%20subject%20above%20and%20feel%20free%20to%20modify%20this%20body%20leaving%20a%20small%20thought.%20An%20automatic%20response%20will%20then%20guide%20you%20to%20the%20following%20steps%20%3A)) or write an e-mail to help.aaad@gmail.com and write "[GW]" in the subject, and be sure to include also a small thought :). An automatic reply will guide you to the stepts to take after.

### Why the heck do I need this app? Can’t I just install the apps by myslef?

Well yes, you could, but they would not appear in Android Auto. Since the beginning of 2018 the custom apps for Android Auto are blocked by Google, but AAAD installs them in a special way in order to actually see the apps on Android Auto. And no root is needed! Call it magic, if you will.

### I have a warning from Google Play Protect warning me about your app! Is this app a malware?

AAAD does not contain any malware, and neither the apps inside it. Google obviously doesn't like Android Auto modding because of driving security. If you want to avoid any warning you'd want to know that Google Play Protect does not really have any anti-virus feature, rather it just warns of apps that Google doesn't like because of various reasons (e.g. installing other apps like Google Play Store does or contain third party in app purchase system). You can safely disable it by heading into Google Play Store's settings.

### Why only those apps? Where is YouTube? Where is Netflix? Where is Instagram?

Not all apps are compatible with Android Auto. You can’t just pick an app and sledge hammer it into Android Auto. I’ve included basically almost every Android Auto app known to date, and the only responsibility of AAAD is to make them available in Android Auto. 

### How do I update the apps installed from AAAD?

AAAD will always download latest version of an app. If one of the apps that you've installed through AAAD gets an update, you can open AAAD and download the update. At the moment, there's no update checker, but I'm planning on making it! 

### Will you hold my bank account/credit card informations?

No. All the details of payment are held by Stripe Inc. and not processed nor passed to myself in any way. Also, I don't really care. 

### Will this app be available on the Play Store?

No. It is only officially distributed on GitHub.

# License

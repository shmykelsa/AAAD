Android Auto Apps Downloader (AAAD) is an app for Android Phones that downloads popular Android Auto 3rd party apps and installs them in the correct way to have them in Android Auto. 

For the first time in 3 years, now users with **non-rooted Android devices** can enjoy these apps made for Android Auto, and Android Auto Apps Downloader does it all for you. Simply select an app you want to install on your phone and the download will begin. Once completed, install the given app with the classic Android interface and you can start enjoying the app you’ve just downloaded on Android Auto.

### No need for a PC. No developer options. No need of grabbing APKs and patch them. No root needed

AAAD can be easily installed on any Android phone and the whole installing process takes place only on it. You will not need to activate developer settings, neither in main settings nor in Android Auto. 

The main goal of this app is having the listed apps in Android Auto with a pain free experience and, most of all, without requiring a rooted phone. 

If you are instead running a rooted device, you might want to consider the free alternative [AA AIO TWEAKER](https://github.com/shmykelsa/AA-Tweaker), which has an alternative root method to patch the apps and it has a lot of other cool features that you can activate or pre-activate on Android Auto!

AAAD is free and offers in app purchases. The free version of the app allows up to 1 download every 30 days. With the PRO version you can enjoy the full experience and download as many times as you want, forever!

# Notes

Android Auto Apps Downloader **does not grant** in any way that the provided apps available for installing will actually work on Android Auto. The installing method can fail anytime if Google applies changes to Android Auto. Any software installed by Android Auto Apps Downloader is provided "as it is" and no support can be given by me for malfunctioning apps or malfunctioning Android Auto. 

# F.A.Q.

### How can I have support for this app?

You can contact help team through AAAD app (top right menu > "help"). We are a very small team working from Italy so please keep patience with us in case you write us over night!

### How do I obtain a license?

To get started, press the bottom text of the AAAD app.

### Can I pay for a license outside the app?

Sure you can. Feel free to [pay through Stripe](https://buy.stripe.com/6oU7sKbscaLe0El2fdcAo01) or donate any amount (equal or bigger than the asking price - 3.99 EUR) [via PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=V666UVPT9C5CJ), and keep the donation receipt (bank statement, confirmation page, e-mail etc.). Then please [click here](mailto:help.aaad@gmail.com?subject=%5BGW%5D&body=Please%20don%E2%80%99t%20modify%20the%20subject%20above%20and%20feel%20free%20to%20modify%20this%20body%20leaving%20a%20small%20thought.%20An%20automatic%20response%20will%20then%20guide%20you%20to%20the%20following%20steps%20%3A)) or write an e-mail to help.aaad@gmail.com and write "[GW]" in the subject, and be sure to include also a small thought :). An automatic reply will guide you to the stepts to take after.

### What will a license of AAAD give me?

The license for AAAD pro will give you access to unlimited downloads.

### Do I have to buy a license to have the apps working while the vehicle is not parked?

No. AAAD pro does only give access to unlimited downloads.

### I've downloaded the app "xxx" from AAAD but it's not working well. What can I do?

The best thing is to ask the app's developer as we do not offer support for the apps inside AAAD. The apps are provided "as-is", and being developed by someone else, nobody from AAAD will be able to give the proper technical support for them. As long as the app is listed on Android Auto, apart from the "No new messages during drive" bug, then AAAD is working just as designed. If your app is not listed at all or suffers from the "No new messages during drive" contact help through AAAD app (top right menu > "help").

### Why the heck do I need this app? Can’t I just install the apps by myslef?

Well yes, you could, but they would not appear in Android Auto. Since the beginning of 2018 the custom apps for Android Auto are blocked by Google, but AAAD installs them in a special way in order to actually see the apps on Android Auto. And no root is needed! Call it magic, if you will. If you have a rooted phone, check out [AA AIO TWEAKER](https://github.com/shmykelsa/AA-Tweaker) instead.

### I have a warning from Google Play Protect warning me about your app! Is this app a malware?

AAAD does not contain any malware, and neither the apps inside it. Google obviously doesn't like Android Auto modding because of driving security. If you want to avoid any warning you'd want to know that Google Play Protect does not really have any anti-virus feature, rather it just warns of apps that Google doesn't like because of various reasons (e.g. installing other apps like Google Play Store does or contain third party in app purchase system). You can safely disable it by heading into Google Play Store's settings.

### Why only these apps? Where is YouTube? Where is Netflix? Where is Instagram?

Not all apps are compatible with Android Auto. You can’t just pick an app and sledge-hammer it into Android Auto. As a rule of thumb, no app from Google Play Store will be ever included in AAAD (unless such app has a different APK distributed in another platform). Apps coming from the Play Store are automatically available on Android Auto. Obviously, Google allows only certain types of apps on its store (navigation, music, messages, VOIP). Whenever an app implements Android Auto as functionality, it can't be falling in a different category from the ones allowed by Google. 

AAAD includes basically almost every Android Auto app known to date, and the only responsibility of AAAD is to make them available in Android Auto. If you know for sure there's an app compatible with Android Auto that is not included in AAAD, write to [submit.aaad@gmail.com](mailto:submit.aaad@gmail.com)

### How do I update the apps installed from AAAD?

AAAD will always download latest version of an app. If one of the apps that you've installed through AAAD gets an update, you can open AAAD and download the update. At the moment, there's no update checker, but I'm planning on making it! 

### Will you hold my bank account/credit card informations?

No. All the details of payment are held by Stripe Inc. and not processed nor passed to myself in any way. Also, I don't really care. 

### Will this app be available on the Play Store?

No. It is only officially distributed on GitHub.

### Has the license an expiration date?

No. AAAD is not a subscription, and once a license is obtained you won't be charged anymore.

### What happens if I change my device?

You can transfer a license with the feature "Transfer license" on the top right menu. The license will be crypted inside the device with a key that we will not hold in any way and the above method is the only way to move a license for AAAD pro.

### What happens if I uninstall AAAD?

Nothing. The date for next download will not be impacted and neither your AAAD pro version.
